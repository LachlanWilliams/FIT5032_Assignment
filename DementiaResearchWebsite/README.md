## Suggested changes

As per my interview with Gonazlo, I have come up with a list of necessary changes that need to be made by the next implementation of the website.

- Admin dashboard showing all users and all carers (approved, pending, rejected)
- Logging in users can request to be a carers which will take the user to a pending approval page
- Carers will not have a be able to see the our carers page, instead have my profile page
- Firebase for logins
- Hardcode admin user in
- Admin can add research pages in
- Carer, once approved has to complete their profile
